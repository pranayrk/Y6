					### 1.6 Robots of the future
					##### Artificial Intelligence

					**What is Artificial Intelligence?**  
					* **Artificial Intelligence** , or **AI**, is when computers or machines are made to think and learn like humans. 
					* It helps them do things that usually need human brains: like recognizing voices, understanding pictures, and making decisions.

					* To be called an AI, a computer needs to be taught to think like a human. This process is called **machine learning**.

					### 1.6 Robots of the future
					##### Artificial Intelligence


					**How Does AI Learn? -- Machine Learning**

					* Most AI learn from lots of information:
						* We show it a huge number of examples, and it figures out patterns. 
						* The more examples it sees, the smarter it gets. 
						* Example: Alexa, ChatGPT
					* Other AI learn from self-play:
						* The AI plays a game against itself a huge number of times
						* Eventually, it learns the patterns that allow it to win the game
						* Example: DeepBlue Chess Engine

					The Three Laws of Robotics are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov.

					* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
					* A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
					* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

					##### How Do Self-Driving Cars Work?

    					* **Sensors and Cameras:** These help the car "see" the environment and detect obstacles.
    					* **Computer Processor:** This is like the car's brain. It processes the information from the sensors and cameras, deciding how to navigate the roads safely.
    					* **GPS:** GPS helps self-driving cars know their location and plan routes.
    					* **Machine Learning:** The car learns from data to improve its driving over time. It can recognize patterns and make decisions based on past experiences.

					##### Benefits of Self-Driving Cars

    					* **Safety:** They can reduce accidents caused by human errors like distractions or fatigue.
    					* **Accessibility:** They can help people who can't drive, like the elderly or those with disabilities, to get around.
    					* **Efficiency:** They can reduce traffic jams by communicating with other cars and choosing the best routes.

					##### Q. How did the internet start?
					* The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information.
					* A reason in the formation of the Internet was the Cold War. 
					* This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) for military use
					* ARPANET evolved into what we now know as the Internet. 
					* The internet was fully established on January 1, 1983

					<p>The inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners Lee</p>
					<p>WWW refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Q. How was the world-wide-web invented?
					* Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN.
					* CERN had scientists working at many different places so they needed a way to share documents easily.
					* info.cern.ch/ was the address of the world's first website which went live in November 1992. 
					* Like other early websites, it has only **text** and **hypertext**
					* www.aliweb.com/ was launched in 1993, and was the first search engine.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Q. What is text and hypertext?
					* A **text** is a passage of words that conveys a set of meanings to the person who is reading it.
					* **Hypertext** is text with hyperlinks to other text that the reader can immediately access.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Activity for Lab
					* Open http://info.cern.ch/ and compare how it looks different to modern websites
					* Open http://www.aliweb.com/  and compare how it looks different to the first website.

					##### Q. What are the components of a webpage?
					* **Headings:** a title at the head of a page or section
					* **Images:** pictures that were created or copied and stored in electronic form
					* **Links:** a connection between two webpages
					* **Logo:** images, texts, or shapes that depict the name and purpose of a business 
					* **Menu:** a list of buttons or facilities displayed on screen.
					* **Text:** a passage of words
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					##### Q. How do you make a website?
					* Every website is based on HTML
					* HTML is a way to tell the browser to display headings, images, links, etc
					* HTML can be difficult to understand so we can also use a **web page editor** like wix.com
					* These web page editors allow you to add components directly and they will generate the HTML for you
