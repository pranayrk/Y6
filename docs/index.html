					### 1.6 Robots of the future
					##### Artificial Intelligence

					**What is Artificial Intelligence?**  
					* **Artificial Intelligence** , or **AI**, is when computers or machines are made to think and learn like humans. 
					* It helps them do things that usually need human brains: like recognizing voices, understanding pictures, and making decisions.

					* To be called an AI, a computer needs to be taught to think like a human. This process is called **machine learning**.
				</section>

					### 1.6 Robots of the future
					##### Artificial Intelligence


					**How Does AI Learn? -- Machine Learning**

					* Most AI learn from lots of information:
						* We show it a huge number of examples, and it figures out patterns. 
						* The more examples it sees, the smarter it gets. 
						* Example: Alexa, ChatGPT
					* Other AI learn from self-play:
						* The AI plays a game against itself a huge number of times
						* Eventually, it learns the patterns that allow it to win the game
						* Example: DeepBlue Chess Engine

					The Three Laws of Robotics are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov.

					* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
					* A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
					* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Q. How was the world-wide-web invented?
					* Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN.
					* CERN had scientists working at many different places so they needed a way to share documents easily.
					* info.cern.ch/ was the address of the world's first website which went live in November 1992. 
					* Like other early websites, it has only **text** and **hypertext**
					* www.aliweb.com/ was launched in 1993, and was the first search engine.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Q. What is text and hypertext?
					* A **text** is a passage of words that conveys a set of meanings to the person who is reading it.
					* **Hypertext** is text with hyperlinks to other text that the reader can immediately access.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Activity for Lab
					* Open http://info.cern.ch/ and compare how it looks different to modern websites
					* Open http://www.aliweb.com/  and compare how it looks different to the first website.

				<section data-markdown>
					##### Q. How do you make a website?
					* Every website is based on HTML
					* HTML is a way to tell the browser to display headings, images, links, etc
					* HTML can be difficult to understand so we can also use a **web page editor** like wix.com
					* These web page editors allow you to add components directly and they will generate the HTML for you

					#### Algorithms and Programs
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					##### Question: What is an algorithm?

					* An **algorithm** is a process or set of rules to be followed in problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
					* Algorithms contain very detailed instructions of every step needed to achieve a particular result.
					* Since computers are very good at doing exactly what they are told, using a good algorithm will help the computer do the task properly.

					* **Low level** programming languages are easier to translate to binary
					* This usually means they are much more difficult to use
					* However, low level programming languages are quite powerful and can complete tasks much more quickly
					* **High Level** programming are closer to our human languages
					* This makes high level programming languages a lot easier to understand
					* using a high level programming language can make the computer take longer to complete a task

					<p>In Scratch, you use the mouse to drag and drop code blocks, so little typing is needed. Here’s an example of the snap-together code blocks.</p>
					<img src="images/scratch_example_1.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The most basic object in Scratch is the <b>sprite</b>. Sprites appear on the <b>Stage</b> and their code blocks control their behavior.</p>
					<img src="images/scratch_editor.jpeg"></img>
					<p>The editor automatically starts with a cat sprite for all new projects, but you can delete it or add more sprites. </p>
					<p>You can program a sprite by adding code blocks to the <b>Code Area</b> on the right side of the screen.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>To create a new code block, drag it from the center Block Palette to the Code Area.</p>
					<p>The code blocks that have a notch on top and bump on the bottom are called <b>stack blocks.</b></p>
					<img height="300" src="images/adding_blocks.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Stack blocks can also fit in between blocks.</p> 
					<img src="images/adding_blocks_2.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You can change a white field inside a block by clicking the white area and entering new input.</p>

					<p>The rounded blocks are called <b>reporter blocks.</b> They fit inside the white fields.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>To remove blocks, drag them out of the script.</p>
					<img src="images/deleting_blocks.png"></img>
					<p>You can also right-click a block and select <b>Delete Block</b> from the menu that appears.</p>
