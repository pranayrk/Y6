	**What is Artificial Intelligence?**  
	* **Artificial Intelligence** , or **AI**, is when computers or machines are made to think and learn like humans. 
	* It helps them do things that usually need human brains: like recognizing voices, understanding pictures, and making decisions.

	* To be called an AI, a computer needs to be taught to think like a human. This process is called **machine learning**.

	**How Does AI Learn? -- Machine Learning**

	* Most AI learn from lots of information:
	* We show it a huge number of examples, and it figures out patterns. 
	* The more examples it sees, the smarter it gets. 
	* Example: Alexa, ChatGPT
	* Other AI learn from self-play:
	* The AI plays a game against itself a huge number of times
	* Eventually, it learns the patterns that allow it to win the game
	* Example: DeepBlue Chess Engine

	The Three Laws of Robotics are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov.

	* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
	* A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
	* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

	##### How Do Self-Driving Cars Work?

	* **Sensors and Cameras:** These help the car "see" the environment and detect obstacles.
	* **Computer Processor:** This is like the car's brain. It processes the information from the sensors and cameras, deciding how to navigate the roads safely.
	* **GPS:** GPS helps self-driving cars know their location and plan routes.
	* **Machine Learning:** The car learns from data to improve its driving over time. It can recognize patterns and make decisions based on past experiences.

	##### How Do Robot Surgeries Work?

	* **Surgeon Controls:** The surgeon sits at a console and controls the robot's movements
	* **Robot Arms:** The robot has multiple arms equipped with surgical instruments and cameras. These arms can move with great precision.
	* **3D Vision:** The surgeon sees a high-definition image of the surgical area

	##### Benefits of Robot Surgeries

	* **Precision:** Robots can make very small, precise movements that are difficult for human hands to achieve.
	* **Minimally Invasive:** Smaller cuts are needed, which means less pain and quicker recovery.
	* **Less Blood Loss:** Precise movements result in less damage to tissues and blood vessels.
	* **Reduced Risk of Infection:** Smaller incisions mean a lower risk of infections.
