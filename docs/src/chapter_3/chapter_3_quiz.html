	<h3>Calculating the average</h3>
	<p>Write a Scratch program to calculate the average of some numbers entered by the user. You do not know how many numbers the user will choose to enter.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make a new variable called <b>total</b>. This will keep the total of all the numbers the users entered.</li>

		<li>Make a new variable called <b>count</b>. This will keep a count of how many numbers the users entered.</li>
		<li>Make a new variable called <b>average</b>. We will calculate the average and store it in this variable</li>
	</ul>
	<p>$$ \text{average} = \frac{\text{total}}{\text{count}}$$</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>The algorithm for the code is provided below</p>
	<pre>
When the program starts:
	Set the total to 0
	Set the count to 0
	loop forever:
		ask the user to enter the next number
		if the user does not enter anything or enters 0:
			set the average to total/count
			say the average
			stop the program
		otherwise:
			add the answer to the total
			add 1 to the count
