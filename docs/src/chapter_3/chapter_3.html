					##### Question: What is an algorithm?

					* An **algorithm** is a process or set of rules to be followed in problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
					* Algorithms contain very detailed instructions of every step needed to achieve a particular result.
					* Since computers are very good at doing exactly what they are told, using a good algorithm will help the computer do the task properly.

					##### Question: What is a programming language?

					* programming languages are a way of instructing a computer to do a certain task
					* computers only understand binary numbers
					* programming languages help translate our instructions into binary so that the computer can understand them

					##### Question: What is scratch?

					* **Scratch** is a free programming environment that runs in your web browser. 
					* Scratch is a high-level, block-based visual programming language 
					* It was designed by the MIT Media Lab in 2003. 
					* Scratch users can create programs by snapping together code blocks in the Scratch editor.
					* To use scratch, we will sign up at https://scratch.mit.edu/
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					##### Question: What is the difference between a low level and a high level programming language?
					* **Low level** programming languages are easier to translate to binary
					* This usually means they are much more difficult to use
					* However, low level programming languages are quite powerful and can complete tasks much more quickly
					* **High Level** programming are closer to our human languages
					* This makes high level programming languages a lot easier to understand
					* using a high level programming language can make the computer take longer to complete a task

					**Q.1 What are three key aspects of programming?**

					* **Sequence**: Running a set of instructions *in a particular order*
					* **Selection**: Making choices
					* **Iteration:** Doing something more than once

					**Q.2 What is a variable?**

					A **variable** refers to data stored in the computer under a certain name. The data linked to a variable is stored in the computer's memory.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					**Q3. How does Scratch allow for sequencing?**

					Scratch programs have code blocks that are executed in order from top to bottom.

					**Q4. How does Scratch allow for selection?**

					* Scratch programs have **if/else** blocks. 
					* An **if** block will run the block inside it only if a condition is true. 
					* If the condition is not true, then the block inside the **else** block will be run.

					**Q5. How does Scratch allow for iteration?**

					* Scratch has **repeat** blocks and **forever** blocks. 
					* Repeat blocks will repeat the blocks inside it a certain number of times.
					* Forever blocks will repeat the blocks inside it for the duration of the program.

					### Task 0: Making a scratch account
					* Visit **https://scratch.mit.edu**
					* Click **Join Scratch**
					* Continue the steps to register an account

					Write down  your username, you will need it to log in later

					<p>In Scratch, you use the mouse to drag and drop code blocks, so little typing is needed. Here’s an example of the snap-together code blocks.</p>
					<img src="images/scratch_example_1.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The most basic object in Scratch is the <b>sprite</b>. Sprites appear on the <b>Stage</b> and their code blocks control their behavior.</p>
					<img src="images/scratch_editor.jpeg"></img>
					<p>The editor automatically starts with a cat sprite for all new projects, but you can delete it or add more sprites. </p>
					<p>You can program a sprite by adding code blocks to the <b>Code Area</b> on the right side of the screen.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>To create a new code block, drag it from the center Block Palette to the Code Area.</p>
					<p>The code blocks that have a notch on top and bump on the bottom are called <b>stack blocks.</b></p>
					<img height="300" src="images/adding_blocks.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Stack blocks can also fit in between blocks.</p> 
					<img src="images/adding_blocks_2.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You can change a white field inside a block by clicking the white area and entering new input.</p>

					<p>The rounded blocks are called <b>reporter blocks.</b> They fit inside the white fields.</p>
					<img src="images/reporter_block_1.jpeg"></img>
					<img src="images/reporter_block_2.jpeg"></img>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>To remove blocks, drag them out of the script.</p>
					<img src="images/deleting_blocks.png"></img>
					<p>You can also right-click a block and select <b>Delete Block</b> from the menu that appears.</p>
