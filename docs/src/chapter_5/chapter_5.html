	<h3>What is a survey?</h3>
	<img src="images/survey_example.png"></img>
	<p>A <b>survey</b> is a method to gather information from people</p>
	<p>It consists of a series of questions to gather information on a particular subject</p>
</section>
<section>
	<p>Once a survey has been conducted and information has been gathered, they are then turned into <b>data</b> which can be analysed</p>

	<p>Digital surveys are faster to launch than speaking with people individually</p>
</section>
<section>
	<ul>
		<li>Surveys are a reliable, low cost and convenient research method</li>

		<li>However, drawbacks of surveys include <b>survey fatigue</b> and <b>potential misunderstandings</b></li>
		<li>Ideally you want to capture the authentic thoughts, feelings and interests of your respondents.</li>

		<li>When a gap opens between the data in your surveys and the real feelings of the respondents its called <b>survey bias</b></li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<ul>
		<li>There are two main types of surveys: <b>interviews</b> and <b>questionnaires</b></li>
		<li>In an interview, the surveyor goes to the respondent and sits with them to ask the questions</li>
		<li>A questionnaire, on the other hand, is just handed to the respondent and they can answer at their own pace</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="400" src="images/open_ended_vs_closed_ended.png"></img>
	<p>It is easier to make data using information from close-ended questions</p>
	<p>open-ended questions allow more flexibility in response and are useful for exploring new ideas</p>

	<p>A multiple choice question is an example of a <b>close-ended question</b></p>

	<p>Close ended questions are easier to analyse</p>

	<p>Imagine you are asked to collect information about residents in your town</p>

<section>
	<img height="500" src="images/sampling_town_many.png"></img>
	<p>It might take too much time to collect information from everyone in the town</p>
</section>
<section>
	<img src="images/sampling_town_representative.png"></img>
	<p>Instead, we use the concept of <b>sampling</b></p>
	<p>Sampling is a technique of representing the whole population looking at just a <b>sample</b> or smaller part</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h5>How do you use sampling effectively?</h5>
	<ul class="fragment">
		<li>using a big enough sample</li>
		<li>making the sample representatives random</li>
		<li>choosing multiple sample groups</li>
	</ul>
